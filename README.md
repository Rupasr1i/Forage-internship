 **Internship Project: Call Centre & Churn Analysis with Power BI Visualization**
 
Welcome to the GitHub repository for my internship project, conducted in collaboration with PwC through the Forage platform. In this project, I had the opportunity to work on call centre data and perform churn analysis on telecom data, leveraging the capabilities of Power BI for visualization.

**Project Overview**

**Call Centre Analysis**

**Key Findings:**

Overall Customer Satisfaction: We examined customer satisfaction levels to understand the quality of service provided.
Overall Calls Answered/Abandoned: We analyzed the efficiency of the call centre in handling incoming calls.
Calls by Time: Investigated call patterns across different times to identify peak hours.
Average Speed of Answer: This metric allowed us to evaluate how quickly calls were answered.
Agent's Performance Quadrant: We plotted Average Handle Time (talk duration) against the number of calls answered, providing insights into agent efficiency.

**Churn Analysis**

**Key Findings:**

**Churn Rate:** We calculated the churn rate to understand customer attrition.
Services Each Customer Has Signed Up For: We explored the services customers subscribed to, including phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV & movies.

**Customer Account Information:** We delved into customer data, including tenure, contract type, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, total charges, and the number of tickets opened, categorized as administrative and technical.

**Demographic Information:** We considered customer demographics such as gender, age range, and whether they had partners and dependents. 

**Power BI Visualization**

To make our findings more accessible and actionable, we used Power BI to create compelling visualizations that provide a clear understanding of the data. These visualizations can help in decision-making and identifying areas for improvement.

**How to Use This Repository**

**Data Sources:** You can find the raw data sources in the data directory.
**Power BI Reports:** Our Power BI reports and dashboards are available in the powerbi_visualizations folder.

Feel free to explore our project and leverage the insights to drive improvements in call centre operations and customer retention strategies. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out. Your feedback is valuable!

Thank you for visiting this repository, and I hope you find the insights and visualizations helpful.
